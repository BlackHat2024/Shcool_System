Welcome to high school menagemant system made in c++.	


                                                          *****General Requirements*****

First of all the first requirement was to spend 10-15 hours coding this program. I think all lines of my code will prove this. One other requirement was usage of standart function some of standart functions that i have used are : setw() , .compare() , setprecision() etc. Second point was passing an 2D array to a function this i did by creating a 2d array if number of grades of one sutudent was even. I create a nth row and 2 column 2D array and i passed it into a function that returns sum of elements in array. By passing 2D arry in a template function helped me to complete one of the requirements at third point. Defult parameters and Function Overloading (Polymorphism) i used in function of finding averages of students. One function is to find total average and yearly average and the second is to find average of specific subject. In both of these overloading functions i have use defult parameter. Fourth point is Enumerations and Structures. I have create many structure one for teachers , one for students , one for admin ,one for subjects and one for grades. Enumeration i have used to display the year of studies. About the fith point is a if else case with the second point when the number of grades is odd grades are stored in a array and are passed in a recursive function that returns the sum of elements in array. The final requirement was optional but i used it. This requirements were useage of pointers. I have given a value to a poiter by reference and i passed it in function as a pointer but i put as a reference in function parameter. I have use this pointer in several functions. Those were General Requirements.


                                                          *****How to use this program*****

3.Add subject this part is to enter new subject admin is required.
4.Teacher part this is teache part to acces this part you should login as a teacher to try id:1000 password:enea for other teacher you can check txt file only for testing pourpose. After a sucessfull login you have 2 options 1 to add grades 1 to acces your grades by student for more try read instructinos to do it in a proper way. 
5.Student part this is the student part when students can see thair grades and wanted averages by using their id. one student id is :0000 
6.Admin admin part login is needed username:Flavio Password:1234 here you have 3 options to see 1 to see teacher info 2 student info but not grades 3 subject info

                                              *****Challenges and what I would have done differently*****


One chalange that this Project openned to me was segmentation fault. I manage to handle it but i am not sure how. Abot things i would have done differently is to add some more responses and some small update due to having no time to finnish the other subject i let this at this point.


P.S.When the program look like isnt responding press again enter button.


Thank You!
